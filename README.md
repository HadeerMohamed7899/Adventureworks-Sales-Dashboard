# Adventureworks-Sales-Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project is a Power BI dashboard that analyzes sales data from the AdventureWorks database. We utilized the Sales module, which contains information about sales orders, products, and sales territories. The goal of this project is getting insights from various aspects of the sales data.

## DataSet
The dataset can be found through [AdventureWorks Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15&tabs=ssms)

## Project Steps (Conductivity Mode is DirectQuery)
**(1)** Data exploration and defining business logic.

**(2)** Data transformation in PowerBI (Data cleaning, tables creation, dealing with inactive-relationships ....).

**(3)** Data Modeling using Star Schema.

**(4)** Data visualizations and extracting insights.

## Data Model 
Star schema is used as we are focusing on retrieving insights from the data rather than updating or modifying it.
